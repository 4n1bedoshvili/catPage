        <h4>Personality Traits:</h4>
        <p>
          scorpio, symbolized by the Scales, is known for its harmony-seeking
          nature and love of beauty. Ruled by Venus, the planet of love and
          aesthetics, scorpios are drawn to balance, fairness, and elegance in all
          aspects of life. They possess a natural charm and social grace, making
          them excellent diplomats and peacemakers in various situations. Libras
          value relationships deeply and strive to create a harmonious
          atmosphere in their personal and professional lives. Libras are often
          admired for their sense of style and appreciation for art, music, and
          culture. They have a keen sense of justice and are motivated by a
          desire for fairness and equality. While their diplomatic nature allows
          them to see multiple perspectives, it can sometimes lead to
          indecisiveness as they weigh the pros and cons of every situation.
